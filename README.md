# üö® Cyberbullying Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting **cyberbullying in social media platforms** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning models**.  
We used **RoBERTa**, a transformer-based language model, to classify online text (tweets, comments, and posts) into **bullying** or **non-bullying** categories.  
Additionally, we extended the system to analyze **text in images (memes)** using OCR, making the model more robust for real-world scenarios.

## üß† Project Goal
- Detect and classify cyberbullying text from multiple datasets (Main, Reddit, Tweets).  
- Build a deep learning classification model using `RoBERTa`.  
- Visualize results through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Extract and analyze text from meme images using OCR.

## üìä Datasets Used
1. **Main Dataset** ‚Äì Labeled bullying and non-bullying posts.  
2. **Reddit Dataset** ‚Äì Real comments collected from Reddit.  
3. **Tweets Dataset** ‚Äì Tweets labeled as cyberbullying or not.
